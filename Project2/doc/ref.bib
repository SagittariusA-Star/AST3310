    abstract = "{The observed frequencies of solar oscillations have been used to determine the depth of the convection zone. The effect of diffusion of helium and heavy elements on this measurement is studied and it is found that the discontinuity in the composition gradient at the base of the CZ due to diffusion gives rise to some systematic errors in this measurement. Taking into account these systematic errors the base of the CZ is estimated to be at a radial distance of (0.713 ± 0.001) R⊙. Further, the estimated opacity at the base of the CZ is found to be consistent with that calculated from the OPAL opacity tables using the current value of Z/X. Assuming that the OPAL tables correctly represent the opacity of solar material the surface Z/X is estimated to be 0.0245 ± 0.0008.}",

	abstract = {Solar gravity modes have been actively sought because they directly probe the solar core (below 0.2 solar radius), but they have not been conclusively detected in the Sun because of their small surface amplitudes. Using data from the Global Oscillation at Low Frequency instrument, we detected a periodic structure in agreement with the period separation predicted by the theory for gravity dipole modes. When studied in relation to simulations including the best physics of the Sun determined through the acoustic modes, such a structure favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the rest of the radiative zone.},
